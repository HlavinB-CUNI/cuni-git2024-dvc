Data Version Control (DVC) is a method developed specifically to deal with large data sets within version control systems. 
Oftentimes, DVC is used in cooperating with Git in order to allow the user to manage code file sets as well as the data sets that accompany them. 

Why should someone nut just only use Git? Well with Git, while it is useful to use for code files, Git struggles with quickly adding and synchronizing database 
sets and other large quantities of variables of information. With DVC, the data can be stored outside of the Git tracking system and hosted anywhere.
