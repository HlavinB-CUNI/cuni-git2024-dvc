Data Version Control (DVC) uses a pretty simple procedure to deal with (even with Git). 
Below is such a procedure. 

1) Installation of DVC 
	- Usually this is done with Anaconda 
	
2) Creation of Directory 
	- This can be in any manner of your choosing. For the sake of this class, Git Bash being used for all purposes makes sense
	- Make sure file names are relevant
	- Make an initial commit
	
3) Initialize DVC with "dvc init" command
